# Bamazon

* This is a Amazon-like storefront app using MySQL and Node. 
* This app will take in orders from customers, show the customers total cost, and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 
* If there is insufficient quantity of the product that the customer wants, they will be alerted and the app will restart so they can try again.
